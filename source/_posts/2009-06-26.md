During the past few months I’ve been working on the “La Généalogie des Gerthoffer 1676-1988″ book to make its content available as an electronic version via a dedicated genealogy online software.

Written by Antoine Gerthoffer, following years of investigation, this book contains lots of details about our genealogy with explanations, old documents, pictures …

As far as I’m aware two versions have been published; 1676-1978 and an update in 1988.

Until now a bit more than 1850 people have been referenced online. It gives us a solid basis to continue Antoine’s work.

We will begin by using the following methods for our investigations:
* Facebook, a lot of Gerthoffer(t) are using Facebook
* Specialized websites (ancestry.com, geneaweb.com, …), sadly most of them require payment of a monthly fee.
* Search engines  (google, yahoo, …)

Right now PhpGedView software is used for the online version, a few customization steps will be necessary in order to make it easy to use. Keeping an eye on Privacy topics.

UPDATE 2024: The server hosting phpgedview has been decomissioned, the GEDCOM file can be [vizualized here](https://genealogy.gerthoffert.info) or [downloaded here](https://genealogy.gerthoffert.info/gerthoffert-2024-08-10.ged)
